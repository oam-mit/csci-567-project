# Repository 1 for CSCI 567 project

In this repository, we experiment with the basic model - Linear Regression, SVR

`utils.py` has the code where we perform all the data cleaning and preprocessing. It has the utility function to make the output file as per the Kaggle Competition. `code.ipynb`, `test.ipynb`, `correlaton_coeff_pca.ipynb` has the code to generate the results.
